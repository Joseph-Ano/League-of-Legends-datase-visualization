    "This data set contains the list of every champion either picked or banned during the 2021 League of Legends World tournament. As metioned in its kaggle page, the main statistics of this particular data set include the champion name, position, pick rate, ban rate, pick+ban rate, and more individual champion statistics (Kill, Death, Assist, KDA rate, etc). Each column also has a breif description explaining the variable.\n",

All of the data comes from the analysts and data scrapers at Oracles Elixir who retrive the data from several sources including including Match History pages, [lolesports.com](https://lolesports.com), [lpl.QQ.com](https://lpl.qq.com), [Leaguepedia](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Esports_Wiki), the Riot Games solo queue APIs, and more "

    "### EDA 1: What Position is capable of doing the most share of damage in a team?\n",
    "A team usually consists of 5 different positions namely `Top`, `Middle`, `Jungle`, `ADC`, and `Support`. Although these positions do not have to be followed at all, it has become the main way that almost all players use to play the game. Knowing which position is your main source of damage allows your team to play around that position and protect them so that they can maximize their damage output. In light of this, the EDA wants to know which position is capabable of doing the most damage in a team (`DMG%`) which will help teams know who to protect and who to target first during a team fight.

For ADC, Jungle and Top, any of the three measures of central tendency (mean, meadian, mode) can be used since they are all normally distributed and thus we will also use the median for these 3 categories. \n",

    "**ANSWER:** Based on the stastitics that we computed for earlier, and the histograms/box plots that we produced, we can say that the position capable of doing the most damage share in a team is the `ADC` position since it has the highest median among the group. In light of this, it is advised for teams to target the enemy ADC first while priotizing their own ADC in team fights. Once the ADC has been defeated, the next position that deals the most damage share would be `Top`, followed by `Middle`, then `Jungle`, and lastly `Support`. Taking out the enemy champions in this order will greatly decrease the fighting power of the enemy team. "
